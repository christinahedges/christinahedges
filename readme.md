I'm **Dr. Christina Hedges**, an astrophysicist, research scientist, and software developer
working with NASA missions to better understand exoplanets.

I specialize in building **open-source tools**, designing **data pipelines**, and
leading **space science projects** —translating raw mission data into scientific discovery. My work focuses on data analysis and building staistical models to better understand data from space satellites.
I've worked on 3 NASA mission so far since obtaining my PhD in 2017.

I’ve led software efforts for the **TESS** and **Pandora** missions, and I help shape
how space telescopes plan, process, and distribute data to the community.

### What I Do?

- 🔭 Design software for processing science data from space telescopes, mission planning, design and simulation.
- 🧪 Provide data exploration and analysis for NASA missions to better understand systematics and instrument performance
- 📦 Build Python tools for scientists and the community to better access and understand NASA data
- 🛰️ Lead data processing for NASA small satellite missions like NASA Pandora
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Mentor scientists and support open science

### Why This Site?

This site acts as a **technical portfolio**. You can explore files in the sidebar to see:

- My research areas and published work
- Software projects I've written and contributed to
- Tutorials I've written
- More about NASA missions I've worked on
- My CV, available as a PDF

Thanks for visiting! 🚀
