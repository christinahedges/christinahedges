========================================

My research focuses on space-based exoplanet missions, stellar astrophysics, and building open-source tools that make NASA mission data accessible and reproducible. As part of my research I detect and characterize transitting exoplanets, asteroids, stars and more using NASA's fleet of astrophysics missions.

Some of my research areas include

- 🪐🌍 exoplanet discovery (check out my new paper [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac06cd))
- ⛈️ extracting information about exoplanet atmospheres from HST (check out the repo [here](github.com/christinahedges/ombre))
- 💻 developing new data techniques for NASA survey missions (check out my [recent paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08411))
- 🌈 extracting color information from black and white telescopes (see my paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00044))
- ☄️ Modeling asteroid light curves

## 🤝 Collaboration & Mentoring

I love working with early-career researchers, mentoring postdocs and students, and building cross-institution collaborations. Whether it’s coding, writing, or thinking through data problems, I enjoy time at a white board talking about science problems.

If you're interested in working together, please feel free to drop me an email.
