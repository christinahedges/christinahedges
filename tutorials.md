On this page are a few of the tutorials I've created to help people in astronomy.

## Best Practices for Open Source Software

As part of my work as the Pandora Data Processing Center lead I created a "blank" repository. This is an installable repository with all of my best practices for open source software included, with thorough documentation on why each step is included. Check it out if you are intereted in creating your own packages

## How to Fit Linear Models to Astronomical Data

As part of my research I am frequently fitting complex linear models to data. Below is a set of tutorials that take 2-3 hours to step through that explains from the basics what linear models are and why they are so useful, and how to expand them to higher orders. This tutorial is ideal for grad students interested in fitting astronomical data, and is delivered in Python.
