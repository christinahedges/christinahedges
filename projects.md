Below is a curated selection of software tools and packages Iâ€™ve developed or contributed to, primarily in support of NASA missions and open science in astrophysics. These projects span mission operations, data pipelines, scientific analysis, and user-facing tools designed to empower the broader research community.

Each project is listed with a short description, link to the source code, and, where applicable, documentation and example use cases.

If you're interested in collaborating, contributing, or deploying these tools in your own work, feel free to reach out.
